https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The original dataset contained data from 30 test subjects, who performed 6 different activities 
while a body sensor recorded 561 measurements. The FinalTidyOutput file aggregates these measurements to for each subject, while they 
performed each activity, the average of each of the mean and standard deviation measurements from the sensor. There are 79 of these 
measurements in total.

The variables of the FinalTidyOutput dataset should be interpreted as follows:
1) Activity: which of the 6 activities the subject was performing: 
    (Laying, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Walking Downstairs, Walking Upstairs).
2) Subject: which subject (1-30) was performing the activity.
3-81) Each one of these variables represents the average of one of the 79 mean or standard deviation measurements from the sensor
    while the subject performed the activity specified.
